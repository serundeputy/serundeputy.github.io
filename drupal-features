Drupal Features Workflow
---

Features is a drupal module that lets us export database configuration to code.  This means, for example, if we create
a `content type` and a `view` of that content.  We can package it as a feature export it to code and be able to deploy that
`feature` to our different server environments say typically `staging` and `production`.
